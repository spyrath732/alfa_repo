In this notebook, we present an advanced Question-Answer assistant. Firstly, we performed web scrapping by letting the user define area of interest.
Furthermore, by letting the user choose from the first 10 article web results,we used  BERT and SQUAD pre trained NLP models to  demonstrated  answers to user questions according to the article content.
Finally, we provided some metrics and visualizations regarding BERT tokenization.
