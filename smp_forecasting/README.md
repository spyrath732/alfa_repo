We demonstrate an approach to evaluate prediction models of Energy System Marginal Price with 3 year real data.
With time series analysis , we extracted data insights and we examined various models such as Arima, Arima with Fourier terms , TBATS  and FBPROPHET libraries.
Last but not least, we evaluated these models for both short and long term predictions according to certain metrics and the winner made real future SMP forecast.
